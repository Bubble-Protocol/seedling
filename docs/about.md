# About Seedling

Welcome to Seedling, a decentralized platform designed to embody the essence of free and fair sharing of written content. Seedling is a fully decentralized digital publishing and discovery platform with direct user-to-author tipping.  

Seedling gives authors the autonomy to publish without censorship and the ability to be rewarded directly through cryptocurrency.  Readers can discover diverse voices and perspectives, free from the influence of central algorithms, and directly support authors they believe in through tipping and subscriptions.

Our goal is to create a sustainable model for content creation and consumption that aligns with the ethos of web3 - transparency, user governance and equitable distribution of value.

*Seedling is currently in beta and runs on the Base Goerli testnet.*

## Vision

1. To empower independent authors and journalists with a
decentralized platform that prioritizes freedom of
expression and creative control.

2. To foster a direct and rewarding connection between
creators and their audience through cryptocurrency-based tipping, subscriptions and on-chain profit sharing
models.


## Features

1. **Authors Own Their Content**: 
   
   With Seedling, all content is directly hosted by authors on their GitHub accounts. Writers use the familiar [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format to create their articles. Once written, the article URL is published on the blockchain making it discoverable by other users.  Seedling's smart contracts ensure only verified GitHub account holders can claim and publish their work.

2. **No Account Or Wallet Needed**: 

   *No wallet?  No GitHub account? No worries! Seedling is open for everyone to browse!* 
   
   All content on Seedling is public, shareable with anyone through its unique Seedling URL.  No wallet or account is needed to read shared content. Only tipping and publishing require knowledge of wallets or GitHub.
   
   Seedling's purpose is to present publicly available content from GitHub in a clean, accessible and consistent format, and to make articles discoverable through its user interface.  Future features, such as Publications, will add to Seedlings discovery capabilities by allowing editors to curate content for readers to follow and subscribe.

3. **Cryptocurrency Tipping**:
  
   By connecting their wallet, readers can follow their favourite authors and tip them to show appreciation.  These microtransactions directly reward authors for their valuable content.

4. **Open Source**:

   Transparency is our core value. Seedling's app and smart contracts are open source, allowing the community to review, contribute, and ensure the integrity of the platform. Dive into our codebase [here](https://github.com/Bubble-Protocol/seedling).

### Coming Soon...

5. **Publications**:

   Digital magazines, news outlets and blogs with editorial control and free or paid subscription models.

6. **Different Hosting Options**:

   Publish your content from other platforms or take full control of your content with fully decentralised hosting.

7. **Novel Funding Options For Authors, Influencers & Publishers**:

   Add subscriptions, donations and profit sharing models into your channel.  Open your channel to investors to raise funds for a share of tips and subscriptions.

8. **Pseudonymous Login**:

   Helps journalists around the world express themselves without fear of consequences.
