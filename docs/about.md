# About Seedling

Welcome to Seedling, a decentralized platform designed to embody the essence of free and fair sharing of written content. Seedling is inspired by the simplicity and user-friendly experience of content discovery platforms like Medium, but with a decentralized twist. It's an arena for writers and readers to interact, share insights, and reward captivating narratives through cryptocurrency tipping.

Seedling is currently in beta and runs on the Base Goerli testnet.

## Features

1. **Direct Publishing From GitHub**: 
   
   With Seedling, all content is directly hosted by authors on their GitHub accounts. Writers use the familiar [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format to create their articles. Once written, the article URL is published on the blockchain making it discoverable by other users.  Seedling's smart contracts ensure only verified GitHub account holders can claim and publish their work.

2. **Reading**: 

   *No wallet?  No GitHub account? No worries! Seedling is open for everyone to browse!* 
   
   All content on Seedling is public. Seedling's purpose is to present content in a clean and common format and to make articles discoverable through its user interface.  Future publications will allow editors to curate content for readers to follow and subscribe.

3. **Engagement**:
  
   By connecting their wallet, readers can follow their favourite authors and tip them to show appreciation.  These microtransactions directly reward authors for their valuable content.

4. **Open Source**:

   Transparency is our core value. Seedling's app and smart contracts are open source, allowing the community to review, contribute, and ensure the integrity of the platform. Dive into our codebase [here](https://github.com/Bubble-Protocol/seedling).

## Beta Phase

Seedling is currently in a Beta phase, which means we're testing the waters, ironing out bugs, and continually enhancing the platform. The beta version runs on the Base Goerli testnet. New features are in the pipeline to support GitHub organisations and to allow users to create publications with free or paid subscriptions.

We're excited to invite users to explore Seedling, share feedback, and help us create a truly decentralized content-sharing space.
